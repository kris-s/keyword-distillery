This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.",

DCJS compiles these reports as New York\u2019s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.",

Bridges are analyzed for their capacity to carry vehicular loads. Inspectors are required to evaluate, assign a condition score, and document the condition of up to 47 structural elements, including rating 25 components of each span of a bridge, in addition to general components common to all bridges.   The NYSDOT condition rating scale ranges from 1 to 7, with 7 being in new condition and a rating of 5 or greater considered as good condition\r\n\r\nBridges that cannot safely carry heavy vehicles, such as some tractor trailers, are posted with weight limits. Based upon inspection and load capacity analysis, any bridge deemed unsafe gets closed.",

DCJS compiles these reports as New York\u2019s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Firearm counts are derived from taking the number of violent crimes which involve a firearm. Population data are provided every year by the FBI, based on US Census information. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.",

The data was updated every six months for five years, and is shown on the NYS Broadband Map at www.broadbandmap.ny.gov as well as the National Broadband Map at www.broadbandmap.gov. The data on the map depicts broadband availability at the Census Block level.

Initially, twenty-three programs received grant funds for this purpose. Currently, 186 victim/witness assistance programs have grant awards from the OVS, ranging from $32,000 to over $1.8 million. OVS supports statewide, comprehensive victim/witness assistance services in all sectors of the community. Criminal justice agencies, non-profit victim programs and specific municipal programs all receive support. Examples include DA offices, Probation Departments, YWCAs, local police departments, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations. \r\n\r\nThis data set contains all service locations associated with OVS VOCA awards. It should be noted that some programs do not have a physical address listed, instead, they show a PO Box. In these cases the physical addresses are safeguarded as they are generally Domestic Violence shelters providing services to victims who may be in danger were their location to be disclosed.",

            "description": "The Department of Taxation and Finance administers the statewide New York State general retail sales and compensating use tax, as well as any general retail sales and compensating use tax imposed by a county or municipality in New York State. In addition, the Department administers any taxes imposed on consumer utilities services and other special taxes on selected commodities and services by municipalities and city school districts. This data set presents information on the amount of the distribution of these taxes back to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the ten most recent state fiscal years ended March 31. The state\u2019s sales tax is distributed to the state during the same month of collection. Generally, all local sales taxes collected are distributed back to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the month subsequent to collection. A large majority of the distributions reflect collections from taxable sales reported and remitted during the preceding month. However, the net distributions also include adjustments for prior taxable sales periods resulting from resolving returns processing exception issues, and are also affected by timing of remittances by sales tax vendors as determined by their annual amount of taxable sales. Local taxing jurisdictions\u2019 fiscal years are not identical to the state fiscal year. Distribution information in this data set is presented by state fiscal year to be consistent with other state tax collection information presented in the Annual Statistical Report of New York State Tax Collections. The sales tax distribution information in this data set can be found in this publication.",

Under the approved U.S. Department of Energy plan, customers purchasing appliances qualified for a rebate of $75 ($105 with documented recycling) for ENERGY STAR qualified refrigerators, $75 ($100 with documented recycling) for clothes washers and $50 ($75 with documented recycling) for freezers. $500 rebate ($555 with documented recycling) were also available for high-efficiency dishwashers, clothes washers and refrigerators that meet CEE super efficiency levels when they were purchased as part of a three-appliance package. The plan was approved by the DOE on December 1, 2009. The program was launched February 12, 2010 and closed March 4, 2011 after processing over $16.58 million in rebates",

First, the New York Natural Heritage Program biodiversity database: Rare animals, rare plants, and significant natural communities. Significant natural communities are rare or high-quality wetlands, forests, grasslands, ponds, streams, and other types of habitats.  Next, the 2nd NYS Breeding Bird Atlas Project database: Birds documented as breeding during the atlas project from 2000-2005.  And last, DEC\u2019s NYS Reptile and Amphibian Database: Reptiles and amphibians; most records are from the NYS Amphibian & Reptile Atlas Project (Herp Atlas) from 1990-1999.",

Arts for Transit works closely with the architects and engineers at MTA NYC Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, to determine the parameters and sites for the artwork that is to be incorporated into each station scheduled for renovation. Both well-established and emerging artists contribute to the growing collection of works created in the materials of the system -mosaic, ceramic, tile, bronze, steel and glass. Artists are chosen through a competitive process that uses selection panels comprised of visual arts professionals and community representatives which review and select artists.

The MPA must encompass at a minimum the Census Urbanized Area and the contiguous geographic area likely to become urbanized within the next 20 years.  This data was constructed from the NYS civil boundary files that are owned and maintained by the New York State Office of Cyber Security & Critical Infrastructure Coordination (CSCIC). \r\n\r\nFederal regulation requires that states designate MPOs in Census Urbanized Areas with populations of 50,000 or more.

Over the years, we've consolidated or eliminated departments, cut personnel, refinanced debt, reduced departmental expenditures, extended the life of our landfill, successfully lobbied for increase State aid and identified new sources of revenue.  These actions are the blocks upon which this budget is built, as they continue to have a recurring benefit to our bottom line.  It is important to note that, in fact, 84% of this budget, exclusive of debt services, is related to personnel costs.  The remainder is related to essential operating services, such as utility expenses; building maintenance; insurance costs and the like.",

Data in this dataset are from Table 3, 5 and 7 of the report. It includes the distribution of credit and average amount of credit by credit type and place of residence. A large proportion of EITC claims are paid out in the form of cash rebates to taxpayers. This is because credit claimants are typically low and moderate-income taxpayers who have little or no pre-credit tax liability. However, in a significant number of cases credit claims are used to offset pre-credit New York State tax liability. In the aggregate, approximately 85 percent of credit claimed is typically returned to taxpayers in the form of cash rebates.

Claimants pay no fee for the HCPO\u2019s services, nor does the HCPO take a percentage of the value of the assets recovered.   The mission of the HCPO is threefold: (1) recover assets deposited in banks; (2) recover proceeds of unpaid insurance policies; and, (3) recover art lost, looted, or sold under duress between 1933 and 1945.",
